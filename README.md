ðŸŒ¿ Plant Leaf Disease Detection using CNN This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify plant leaf diseases from images. Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV, it helps in early disease detection, aiding farmers in timely action. The model is trained on plant disease datasets for accurate predictions.
